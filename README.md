<h1>About KMiner:</h1>
		<p>
			KMiner allows you to mine multiple coins easily by automating the switching back and forth of the mining process for each coin.
			If you're interested in mining multiple coins but still want to "set it and forget it," KMiner is for you.
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently KMiner supports the following coins:
			<ul>
				<li>Vertcoin (VTC) on Suprnova</li>
				<li>Monacoin (MONA) on Suprnova</li>
				<!-- <li>Bitcoin via NiceHash Miner</li> -->
			</ul>
			We are working to expand to additional coins that are supported by Suprnova pools, and to additional pools. If one coin in particular
			is of interest to you, please let us know. Aside from stability improvements and bug fixes, expanding the number of coins we support
			is our top priority.
		</p>
		<p>
			With KMiner, you are in control of what you mine. KMiner mines directly the pools of your choice under your account and never uses
			your pool information for any reason aside from connecting to a pool to mine for you. KMiner is free and there is no charge for using
			this tool. You are welcome to share it as you see fit. By using KMiner, you agree to allow KMiner to mine to a pool and account of our
			choosing 1% of the time, or for approximately 15 minutes per day. This helps provide financial support for continued improvements to
			KMiner. If you do not agree to this stipulation, please do not use KMiner.
